## Test Dataset Pattern

TEST01 has 5 days of data entries that show a realistic progression of leader-follower identity dynamics:

1. **Day 1 (March 1, 2025)**
   - Leader: 75% / Follower: 25%
   - Event: "Led team meeting, proposed new project ideas"
   - Novelty: 5/7, Disruption: 3/7, Ordinariness: 2/7
   - Interpretation: Strong leader identity while proposing new ideas

2. **Day 2 (March 2, 2025)**
   - Leader: 65% / Follower: 35%
   - Event: "Follow-up discussions on project implementation"
   - Novelty: 4/7, Disruption: 3/7, Ordinariness: 3/7
   - Interpretation: Slightly reduced leader identity during implementation discussions

3. **Day 3 (March 3, 2025)**
   - Leader: 45% / Follower: 55%
   - Event: "Attended training session led by manager"
   - Novelty: 2/7, Disruption: 4/7, Ordinariness: 5/7
   - Interpretation: Identity switch to follower during training by authority figure

4. **Day 4 (March 4, 2025)**
   - Leader: 30% / Follower: 70%
   - Event: "Followed instructions for implementing new processes"
   - Novelty: 3/7, Disruption: 2/7, Ordinariness: 4/7
   - Interpretation: Strong follower identity when following structured processes

5. **Day 5 (March 5, 2025)**
   - Leader: 55% / Follower: 45%
   - Event: "Balanced role in team collaboration session"
   - Novelty: 4/7, Disruption: 3/7, Ordinariness: 3/7
   - Interpretation: Return to more balanced identity during collaborative work

## Key Identity Patterns

This test data demonstrates several important identity patterns:

1. **Identity Shift**: Transition from leader-dominant to follower-dominant and back
2. **Identity Switch**: Crossing the 50/50 threshold between days 2-3 and 4-5
3. **Context-Dependence**: Identity varies with social context (leading vs. receiving training)
4. **Event Impact**: More novel events correlate with stronger leader identity
5. **Liminality**: Day 5 shows a liminal state where identities are nearly balanced

## Using This Test Data

This test data provides a realistic example for visualizing identity dynamics in the Reporter section. When using the TEST01 ID in the application, you'll be able to see:

- Identity trajectory charts showing the shift over time
- Summary statistics about leader vs. follower dominance
- Event characteristic correlations
- Identity switches analysis

You can use this ID for demonstration purposes or as a reference for what real data patterns might look like.
