This directory contains HTML captures of the Leader-Follower Identity Tracker (LFIT) application.
These captures were made using a simple HTTP client without requiring a browser.

These captures only include the initial HTML of each page and do not include any dynamic content
that would normally be generated by JavaScript after the page loads.

The user data JSON file can be used to analyze the data structure and content.
