# Terminal Captures

This directory contains HTML captures of the Leader-Follower Identity Tracker (LFIT) application made using a simple HTTP client without requiring a browser.

## Purpose

These captures are designed for environments where:
- You're working via SSH without a display
- You don't have access to a browser or GUI
- You need to capture the application's content with minimal dependencies

## Contents

- **HTML Files**: Raw HTML content of each page
- No screenshots are included as this capture method doesn't require a browser

## How to Generate

To regenerate these captures:

```bash
# Make sure the application is running
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the terminal capture script
npm run terminal-capture
```

## Advantages

- Works in minimal environments (just Node.js required)
- No browser dependencies
- Captures the raw HTML structure
- Reliable in headless server environments

## Limitations

- Does not capture visual appearance (no screenshots)
- Does not capture dynamic content generated by JavaScript
- Only captures the initial HTML response from the server

## Usage

These HTML files can be viewed in any browser to get a basic understanding of the application's structure and content.

## Files

- main_page.html: Captured from http://localhost:3000/
- email_preferences.html: Captured from http://localhost:3000/email-preferences.html
- about.html: Captured from http://localhost:3000/about.html
- help.html: Captured from http://localhost:3000/help.html

## Note

These captures only include the initial HTML of each page and do not include any dynamic content
that would normally be generated by JavaScript after the page loads.
